A dictionary web app built with Next.js is a user-friendly online platform that allows users to look up the meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and translations of words from various languages. The app is built with Next.js, a React-based web framework that provides features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting, which makes it fast and efficient.

The app provides an intuitive interface that enables users to search for words easily and quickly. Users can enter a word into the search bar and get immediate results, including the word's definition, pronunciation, and usage examples. The app may also suggest similar words or provide related words to expand the user's vocabulary.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
